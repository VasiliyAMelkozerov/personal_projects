# Overwatch league statistics
<hr>

Introduction: 
I love overwatch, I have loved overwatch for going on 6 years of my life. The characters have unique and expressive designs with cool abilities taht can change the outcome of a match. I really love making huge plays from getting ina good angle that the enemy team isn't paying attention to. Or a sneaky objective takeover for when they are too busy to pay attention

Project planning:
- find leading features to predict win/loss
- find other factors that skew and lead the data
-  my current leading feature to oull from is the map itself and the subsequent data that comes from it
- understand all of the metrics used in the data

To get a comprehensive undertand of what each feature means I will have to do some digging. Of which one of the biggest interesting points so far is that each map has unique objective. There are 5 total map types objective wise. So when I predict the outcome based off of map it will double as objective type.

How will I do this?

I plan to accomplish this by using the appropriate measures

DATA DICTIONARY:
THis is where my definitions for each feature will go

How to reproduce results:
1. Download repository
2. Download the overwatch league map csv data
3. Run the tests

Project goals:
- build a model that can predict higher then 50% which team is going to win or lose
- win or lose are subjective based off of who you are asking from so it has to be encoded
- Find leading features that determine game outcome

Project Description:
The idea and goal behind this project is to model competitions to see who comes out best. This is also keeping in mind that this style of investigation can be applied to the market as well. Because comparing company products to determine success is the monolith of practical mathematics.



Current entry:
This is wonderful practise exercise in working out market conditions as well. What one successful product looks like is completely different from another. Say comparing pans to apples and phones to coaches. In seeing that success is different from each perspective this exercise has taught me that there are independent variables that need to be put into place to help abstract and understand reality.
